## logbook

The logbook directory contains all the code related to the application's logging functionality. I include the main logging module, as well as any utility functions or configurations related to logging.

### Files

#### ./logbook/index.js

The `index.js` file is the entry point for the logbook module. It exports the main `logger` function, which is the primary interface for logging messages throughout the application. The logger function supports different log levels (e.g. debug, info, error) and can be configured to log to various destinations (e.g. console, file, remote service).

#### ./logbook/config.js

The `config.js` file contains the configuration options for the logging system. This includes settings like the default log level, log file path, and remote logging endpoint. I can easily modify the configuration to suit the needs of the deployment environment.

#### ./logbook/utils.js

The `utils.js` file provides a set of utility functions that are used by the logging system. This includes functions for formatting log messages, calculating timestamps, and handling errors that occur during logging.

#### ./logbook/transports/console.js

The `console.js` transport module is responsible for logging messages to the console. It implements the transport interface defined in the main logging module, allowing it to be used as a destination for log messages.

#### ./logbook/transports/file.js

The `file.js` transport module is responsible for logging messages to a file. It implements the transport interface and can be configured to log to a specific file path.

#### ./logbook/transports/remote.js

The `remote.js` transport module is responsible for logging messages to a remote logging service. It implements the transport interface and can be configured with the appropriate endpoint and authentication credentials.
