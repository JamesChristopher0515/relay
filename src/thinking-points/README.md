## thinking-points

The `thinking-points` directory contains the implementation of the `ThinkingPoints` component, which is a reusable UI component that displays a list of "thinking points" with a title and a button to complete or close the component.

### Files

#### ./thinking-points/components/ThinkingPoints.tsx

The `ThinkingPoints` component is the main file in this directory. It is a React component that takes in a `points` array, a `title`, and an optional `onComplete` callback function. The component renders a scrollable list of the `points` with a light bulb icon, the `title`, and a button to either "Continue" or "Back" depending on whether an `onComplete` callback is provided.

The component uses several other components and utilities from the `@mtyk/frontend` library, such as `Flex`, `Txt`, `Icon`, `RelayButton`, and `useDecorationsContext`. It also imports the `faLightbulb` icon from the `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` library.

The main purpose of this component is to provide a consistent and visually appealing way to display a list of "thinking points" or similar content within the application. It is used in various parts of the application where such content needs to be displayed.
