#### ./home/components/Home.tsx

I created the `Home` component as the main entry point for the homepage. It imports and utilizes various UI components from the `@mtyk/frontend/core/components` library to structure and render the homepage content. I designed this component to serve as the top-level container for the homepage, and it is responsible for coordinating the rendering of all other necessary sub-components.
