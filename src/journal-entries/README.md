## journal-entries

The `journal-entries` directory contains the components, actions, and helpers related to the journal entry functionality in the application. I implemented the ability to view, create, edit, and delete journal entries, as well as manage their privacy settings.

### Files

#### journal-entries/actions/viewEditJournalEntry.ts

I created the `viewEditJournalEntry` function to open the `JournalEntryModal` component and display a journal entry for viewing or editing. It takes a `journalEntry` object as a parameter, which is used to populate the modal with the relevant data.

#### journal-entries/components/JournalEntryItemRow.tsx

I developed the `JournalEntryItemRow` component to represent a single journal entry item in a list or grid view. It displays the title, date, and a preview of the journal entry's content. I also implemented functionality to delete the journal entry and open the `JournalEntryModal` to view or edit the entry.

#### journal-entries/components/JournalEntryModal.tsx

I built the `JournalEntryModal` component to render the modal that allows the user to view, create, or edit a journal entry. It includes input fields for the title and body of the entry, as well as controls to set the privacy status and save or cancel the changes.

#### journal-entries/components/JournalEntryPage.tsx

I created the `JournalEntryPage` component to represent the main page for the journal entries feature. It renders a list or grid of journal entries, including a "New Entry" button that opens the `JournalEntryModal` to create a new entry. The data for the journal entries is fetched using the `useGetJournalEntrysQuery` hook.

#### journal-entries/components/JournalEntryPrivacyStatus.tsx

I developed the `JournalEntryPrivacyStatus` component to render the privacy status of a journal entry, including a toggle to change the privacy setting. It is used within the `JournalEntryModal` component.

#### journal-entries/helpers/getJournalEntryTitle.ts

I wrote the `getJournalEntryTitle` helper function to determine the title of a journal entry. If the entry has a non-empty title, it returns the title. Otherwise, it returns a default "Untitled Entry" string.

#### journal-entries/helpers/isJournalEntryNonEmpty.ts

I created the `isJournalEntryNonEmpty` helper function to check whether a journal entry has non-empty content (i.e., the body is not just whitespace). It returns a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered non-empty.
