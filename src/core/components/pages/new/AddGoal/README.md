### Files

#### `NewGoalAdd.tsx`

This file contains the `AddGoal` component, which is responsible for rendering the modal and handling the user's interactions to create a new goal. It uses the `GoalsController` to interact with the backend and save the new goal. The component also utilizes various UI components and hooks from the application's core library, such as `RelayModal`, `useInputAdapter`, and `useClient`.

The `AddGoal` component is the main entry point for the "Add New Goal" functionality, and it is responsible for managing the state and rendering the necessary UI elements.

#### `Styles.ts`

This file contains the styles used by the components in the `AddGoal` directory. It defines the styles for the modal container, text input field, buttons, and other UI elements. The styles are defined using the `StyleSheet` API provided by React Native.

#### `index.tsx`

This file exports the `Goals` component, which is responsible for rendering the list of existing goals. It uses the `GoalsController` to fetch the user's goals and displays them in a scrollable list. The component also includes a button to add a new goal, which triggers the `AddGoal` component to be displayed.

The `Goals` component is the main entry point for the "My Goals" functionality, and it manages the state and rendering of the goal list.
