## Images

This directory contains all the image assets used throughout the application. I import and use these images in various components and screens to provide visual elements and enhance the user experience.

### Files

#### ./Images.ts

This file exports an object `images` that contains references to all the image assets used in the application. Each property of the `images` object corresponds to a specific image file, and the value is a `require` statement that loads the image from the corresponding file path.

The images cover a wide range of functionality, including navigation, user interface elements, emojis, and various icons. I use these images throughout the codebase to provide visual context and enhance the overall user experience.

When adding or updating images, I ensure that I add or modify the corresponding entry in this `Images.ts` file, so that I can easily access and use the images across the application.
