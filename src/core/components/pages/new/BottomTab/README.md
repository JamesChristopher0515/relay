## BottomTab

The `BottomTab` directory contains the implementation of the bottom navigation bar for the application. This navigation bar provides users with quick access to the main sections of the app, including Chat, Logbook, and Resources.

### Files

#### `./BottomTab/SecondTabView.tsx`

This file defines the `BottomTab` component, which is a React component that renders the bottom navigation bar. The component uses various UI elements, such as `TouchableOpacity`, `Image`, and `Text`, to create the navigation buttons. The component also manages the state of the selected tab and updates the UI accordingly.

The `BottomTab` component is responsible for handling the navigation logic when a user taps on a navigation button. It updates the state and then navigates to the corresponding screen, such as the Home, Magazine, or AllCategories screens.

The component imports various styles and assets, such as the `Styles` module and `Images` module, to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.

#### `./BottomTab/Styles.ts`

This file defines the styles used by the `BottomTab` component. It includes styles for the overall container, individual navigation buttons, and the text and icons within the buttons. The styles are defined using the `StyleSheet` API provided by React Native and are exported as a default export.

The styles are designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, using the `react-native-responsive-screen` library to calculate the appropriate sizes and positions.

#### `./BottomTab/index.tsx`

This file exports the `BottomTab` component, which is the main entry point for the `BottomTab` directory. It imports the `BottomTab` component from the `SecondTabView.tsx` file and exports it as the default export.

This file serves as a convenient way to access the `BottomTab` component from other parts of the application, without having to directly import the `SecondTabView.tsx` file.
