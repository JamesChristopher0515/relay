## AddJournalEntry

The `AddJournalEntry` directory contains the code for the "Add Journal Entry" screen in the application. This screen allows the user to create a new journal entry, including a title and a description. The screen also includes some pre-filled content and styling to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

### Files

#### `./AddJournalEntry/Styles.ts`

This file defines the styles used throughout the `AddJournalEntry` screen. It includes styles for the main container, the "Find Goals" activity, the input fields, the buttons, and various text elements. The styles are defined using the `StyleSheet` API from React Native and utilize the `react-native-responsive-screen` library to ensure consistent layout across different device sizes.

#### `./AddJournalEntry/index.tsx`

This is the main file that defines the `AddJournalEntry` component. It imports the necessary dependencies, including the `Styles` module, and defines the component's structure and functionality.

The component renders a `SafeAreaView` to ensure the content is displayed correctly on devices with notches or other display cutouts. It includes the following main elements:

1. A "Find Goals" activity that displays a pre-filled message and a date.
2. An input field for the journal entry title (optional).
3. A multi-line input field for the journal entry description.
4. A bottom container with "Cancel" and "Save" buttons.

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the title and description input fields. When the "Save" button is pressed, the component navigates to the "LogBook" screen to save the journal entry.

This directory and its files provide the necessary functionality and styling for the "Add Journal Entry" screen in the application.
