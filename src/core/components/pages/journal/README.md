## journal

I created this directory to contain the code for the "Journal" page of my application. The Journal page serves as a central hub where users can view and interact with their personal journal entries.

### Files

#### ./index.tsx

I wrote this file as the entry point for the Journal page. It imports the necessary components and defines the `JournalPage` component, which is responsible for rendering the overall layout and structure of the page. The `JournalPage` component uses the `PageLayout` component from my `core/components/layout` module to provide a consistent page structure, and the `AnimatedFlex` component from my `@mtyk/frontend/native/animation/components/AnimatedComponents` module to display a centered "Milestone 5" message.
