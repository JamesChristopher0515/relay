## files

This directory contains a set of utility functions and hooks related to file management and handling within the application. The primary purpose is to provide a consistent and centralized way to interact with files, such as retrieving file URLs and determining if a file is empty or not.

### Files

#### ./hooks/useFile.ts

The `useFile` hook is a custom React hook that provides a simple interface for working with file-related data. It takes an optional `fileId` parameter and returns an object with two properties:

1. `url`: The URL of the file, generated using the `fileUrl` function. If no `fileId` is provided, the URL will be an empty string.
2. `empty`: A boolean indicating whether the `fileId` is empty or not (i.e., `typeof fileId !== 'string'`).

The `fileUrl` function is a utility function that generates the URL for a file based on the provided `fileId`. It uses the `config.apiUrl` value from the `@mtyk/frontend/core/helpers/config` module to construct the URL. If an `imgsrc` parameter is provided and set to `true`, the function will return the URL wrapped in the `url()` function, which is useful for setting background images.

These utilities are designed to provide a consistent and centralized way to work with file-related data throughout the application, ensuring that file URLs are generated correctly and that the handling of empty file IDs is consistent across the codebase.
