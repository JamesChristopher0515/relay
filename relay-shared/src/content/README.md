## helpers/fontAwesomeIconForFile

This directory contains a utility function that maps file MIME types to corresponding Font Awesome icons. I created this to display appropriate file type icons in the user interface.

### Files

#### ./helpers/fontAwesomeIconForFile.tsx

This file exports two functions:

1. `getFontAwesomeIconFromMIME`: This function takes a MIME type string as input and returns the corresponding Font Awesome icon definition. It uses a predefined mapping of MIME types to icon definitions to determine the appropriate icon.

2. `fontAwesomeIconForFile`: This function takes a `Content['file']['file']` object as input and returns the corresponding Font Awesome icon definition based on the file's MIME type. It calls `getFontAwesomeIconFromMIME` internally.

The purpose of these functions is to provide a centralized way to determine the appropriate file type icon to display for a given file. This helps maintain consistency in the user interface and avoids the need to manually map file types to icons throughout the codebase.

The `iconsMap` object in the file contains the mapping of MIME types to Font Awesome icon definitions. This mapping covers common file types such as images, audio, video, documents, and archives. If a MIME type is not found in the mapping, the function will return a generic file icon.

I use these functions throughout the application wherever file type icons need to be displayed, such as in file previews, file lists, or file upload components.
