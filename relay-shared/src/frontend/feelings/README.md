## feelings

The `feelings` directory contains the core components and utilities related to the handling and display of user feelings within the application. This directory is crucial for the application's emotional tracking and expression features.

### Files

#### `./RelayFeeling.tsx`

The `RelayFeeling` component renders a user's feeling, including an associated SVG icon and the feeling's text label. It is a building block for more complex feeling-related components and interfaces throughout the application. The `SvgForFeeling` function renders the appropriate SVG icon based on the provided `feeling` prop.

This file is closely tied to the overall feeling management and expression functionality of the application, serving as a fundamental piece in the emotional tracking and display system.
