## scheduling

This directory contains utility functions related to scheduling and managing recurring events or tasks. The primary purpose is to provide a convenient way to parse and work with schedule specifications, as well as generate the next scheduled date based on a given schedule.

### Files

#### ./scheduling/nextDateFromSchedule.ts

This file exports a function `nextDateFromSchedule` that takes a schedule object (generated by the `scheduleFromString` function) and a starting date, and returns the next scheduled date. It handles the case where the initial date is the same as the next scheduled date, which can happen when the schedule has a non-specific specification like "every 1 day" or "every 1 month".

#### ./scheduling/scheduleFromString.ts

This file exports a function `scheduleFromString` that takes a human-readable string representation of a schedule and returns a schedule object that can be used with the `nextDateFromSchedule` function. It uses the `@breejs/later` library to parse the string and generate the schedule object. The function also performs some additional string transformations to handle common schedule formats like "fortnight", "am/pm", and others.
