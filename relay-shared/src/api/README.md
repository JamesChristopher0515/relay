#### ./api/hooks/useSingleResource.ts

The `useSingleResource` hook is a utility function that provides a consistent interface for interacting with a single resource in the API. It abstracts away the details of making API calls, handling loading and error states, and parsing the response data.

The hook takes a `resource` parameter, which is a string representing the type of resource being fetched (e.g. "user", "post", etc.). It also takes an optional `id` parameter, which is used to fetch a specific instance of the resource.

The hook returns an array with two elements:
1. The fetched data, with dates parsed into JavaScript Date objects.
2. An object containing various functions for interacting with the resource, including `create`, `update`, and `remove`.

The hook uses other API-related hooks, such as `useGetXQuery` and `useUpdateXMutation`, to make the necessary API calls. These hooks are imported from the `../../frontend/api/hooks/useApi` module.

The `parseDates` function from the `@mtyk/frontend/core/helpers` module is used to parse any date-like properties in the fetched data.

The `assert` function from the `@mtyk/frontend/core/helpers/assertDefined` module is used to ensure that an `id` is available before calling the `remove` function.
