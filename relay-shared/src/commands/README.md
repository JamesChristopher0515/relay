## commands

This directory contains the code for the command menu feature in the application. The command menu allows users to execute various actions and commands within the application.

### Files

#### ./commands/components/CommandMenuProvider.tsx

I created the `CommandMenuProvider` component to manage the state of the available command options. It provides a context that other components can use to register and unregister command options, as well as access the list of available options.

I used the `useState` hook in the `CommandMenuProvider` component to maintain a state object that keeps track of the registered command options, organized by component ID. The `registerOptions` and `unregisterOptions` functions are responsible for adding and removing options from this state, respectively.

The `availableOptions` value is derived from the state and represents the complete list of all registered command options.

#### ./commands/hooks/useRegisterCommands.ts

I defined the `useRegisterCommands` hook in this file, which components can use to register their command options with the `CommandMenuProvider`. The hook accepts an array of `Option` objects as an argument, where each `Option` represents a command that can be executed.

Inside the `useRegisterCommands` hook, I generate a unique ID for the component using the `useId` hook. Then, I use the `registerOptions` and `unregisterOptions` functions provided by the `CommandMenuContext` to register and unregister the command options when the component mounts and unmounts, respectively.

I also defined the `CommandMenuContext` in this file, which provides the `availableOptions`, `registerOptions`, and `unregisterOptions` values used by the `CommandMenuProvider` and `useRegisterCommands` hook.
